# Linux Fundamentals Part 1  
**Linux Journey**

## What I knew before the lesson
- I knew nothing about Linux, besides it being an OS.  
- I didn't know how to run commands. The CTF meetings always held me puzzled—I did not know what my peers were doing.

## Difficulties I faced during the lessons
- Trying to understand what each command does and memorize their syntax.  
- Trying to understand what task I was trying to accomplish.

## What I learned after the lessons
- I understood how to run commands in Linux such as:  
  - `ls` (list directory)  
  - `cd` (change directory)  
  - `cat` (output file)  
  - `pwd` (print working directory)  
- Keeping track of the file path was quite a hassle, but I got the hang of it.  
- The shell operators were new concepts. Although I understood what they do:  
  - `&` → run command in background  
  - `&&` → run multiple commands in order  
  - `>` → overwrite an output  
  - `>>` → append an output  
  I wonder what I can do further with these commands.

## What I want to know more about
- `sudo` commands
